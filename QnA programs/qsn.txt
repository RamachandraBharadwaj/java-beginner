Current Account:
A current account is primarily used by businesses, companies, and individuals for managing day-to-day financial transactions.

Current accounts usually do not pay any interest on the deposited amount.
These accounts may require a higher minimum balance to be maintained compared to savings accounts.
They are suited for frequent transactions, payments, and withdrawals.
Savings Account:

A savings account is designed for individuals to save money and earn interest on their deposits.
It usually has limitations on the number of transactions allowed per month, but it provides interest on the deposited amount.
Savings accounts often come with features like ATM/debit cards, online banking, and mobile banking facilities.
They generally have a lower minimum balance requirement compared to current accounts.
Savings accounts are suitable for individuals who want to save money for short-term or long-term goals while earning interest on their deposits.
